# HCDE-310-Autumn-2025-Final-Project'

Hello! This is Forecast Player. This application was created out of a need for music playlists that corresponded to the weather, and a lack of this feature in Spotify's current recommendation algorithm. This application utilizes the Spotify Web API and the National Weather Service API in order to obtain the forecast information of a location and use that forecast data to create a playlist corresponding to that forecast. The playlist will appear in your Spotify library, to which you can edit the playlist however you choose to do so.
